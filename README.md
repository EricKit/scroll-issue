# scroll-issue

Ion-Input will not scroll for keyboard, Input will scroll.

Try clicking the normal input then trying to click the ion-input. When I do, it doesn't work. If you inspect via Safari Web inspector the ion-input is still in the scrolled-up position, though it shows in the lowered position.
